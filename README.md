## Objective
To analyze student performance and retention rates, identify trends, and uncover factors that influence academic success.
## Key Steps in Implementation
1.	Data Sources
 - Student records (grades and attendance), demographic information, and feedback from surveys.
2.	Data Preparation
 - Cleansing: Address inconsistencies by removing or imputing missing grades or attendance records.
 - Aggregation: Group data at course, department, or institutional levels for macro-level analysis.
## Visualizations
1.	Grade Distribution
  - Histograms/Box Plots: Illustrate the range and spread of grades across courses or departments to pinpoint patterns or outliers.
    
2.	Student Demographics
  - Pie Charts/Bar Charts: Analyze academic performance trends by factors like age, gender, or socioeconomic status.
3.	Performance Over Time
  - Line Charts: Visualize semester-by-semester or year-by-year trends in student performance, identifying upward or downward trends.
4.	Retention Rates
  - Bar Charts: Compare retention rates between departments, courses, or academic programs to highlight areas of improvement.


## Actionable Insights
 - Identify Success Factors: Recognize key elements that drive academic success, such as teaching methods, course structure, or student background.
 - Targeted Support Services: Offer additional resources, tutoring, or mentorship programs to at-risk groups based on data insights.
 - Optimize Course Offerings: Modify or prioritize courses based on demand and performance trends to enhance academic outcomes.
